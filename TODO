* Update README
  - Add note about gdal-bin being required even though django-geojson is
    supposed to remove any dependency on django.contrib.gis
    See https://github.com/makinacorpus/django-geojson/issues/75
  - Update README.txt in /docs/import_examples/

* Django Admin (less important as Wagtail Admin integration is on the cards):
  - Change "Enter valid JSON" help-text for location field in django-admin
    Also change validation message (if no location is set)
  - Use textboxes instead of textareas for case insensitive model fields
  - Search & default sort orders in list views
