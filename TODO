* Update README
  Add note about gdal-bin being required even though django-geojson is
  supposed to remove any dependency on django.contrib.gis
  See https://github.com/makinacorpus/django-geojson/issues/75

* Case insensitive for non-postgres DBs (eg: using collation in MySQL)
  Automate as far as possible using migrations (conditional)
  See models.CaseInsensitiveTextField and its usages

* Add citext extension creation into migration for postgres (conditional)

* Django Admin (less important as Wagtail Admin integration is on the cards):
  - Change "Enter valid JSON" help-text for location field in django-admin
    Also change validation message (if no location is set)
  - Use textboxes instead of textareas for case insensitive model fields
  - Search & default sort orders in list views
